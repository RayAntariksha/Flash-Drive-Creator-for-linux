# Flash-Drive-Creator-for-linux
As we all know there is no good flash drive creator on linux like Rufus. So in this repsitory, I (and you as well!) will work on making one.
remeber, in case of any corrupt drives or anything of that sort, the creator and the contributors of this project will not be responsible in any way because this project is still under developement.

Python Libraties:

> pip     24.0
